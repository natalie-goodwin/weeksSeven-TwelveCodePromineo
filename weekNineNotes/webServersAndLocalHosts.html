    <title>Web Servers - Local Hosts</title>

<body>
    
    <!-- Web Servers: Until now, we've been opening files 
    from our browser straight into our file system but 
    when we deploy code over the server to where it is 
    made accessible over the internet, other users cannot 
    access these files directly from our file server. 

    We must use a web/application server to serve the 
    pages and data to the user; we will go to a url on 
    our local host that serves the files to us in our 
    browser just like accessing a website. 
    
    Local host is an alias for our own computer's 
    ip address-->
    
    <!--Installing NPM: Run npn -v to see if it is 
        installed; if it isn't installed, install or 
        update; 
        
        Install HTTP server globally: Run  
        npm install-g http-server ; -g tells npm this 
        is a global install as opposed to installing 
        in the current directory this makes the server 
        accessible in any directory on the CLI by adding 
        it to the path environment variable; launch in 
        any root directory of the project you are working 
        on; 
        
        Run http-server; provides local host which is 
        used in browser to pull up project -->
