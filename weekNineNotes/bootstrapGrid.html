    <!--Bootstrap has a mobile-first design: this means 
        that CSS is structured so that what is on the 
        screen always looks good whether you are seeing 
        it on a laptop or mobile device, and regardless 
        of the size of the device; the CSS layout molds to 
        the shape of the device; the page is responsive: it
        changes the way the page displays and orders content 
        based on the size of the device viewing the page;
        responsive pages are made to look great on any 
        device instead of displaying content the same way 
        on a phone as on a tablet or laptop
    
        Grid System: uses a series of containers, rows, and 
        columns to lay out and align the content; we put 
        rows inside of containers, and columns inside of 
        rows to help organize the content; the columns are 
        responsive to the screensize based on how we define 
        them-->
