<body>
  <!--Bootstrap helps with CSS: Bootstrap allows us to 
    take advantage of a lot of prewritten CSS so we 
    don't have to reinvent the wheel and we can make 
    something look good really quickly; To use Bootstrap, 
    we can either use a Content Delivery Network (CDN): 
    link CSS and JavaScript files we need over the internet
    using absolute paths; or, install files locally and 
    include them in our projects. 

    Installing files locally: go to the CLI directory you 
    need for working on project; 

    Run npm init; enter through everything and type in 
    'yes'; creates a package.json in file; 

    Install Bootstrap: Run npm i bootstrap; 
    Install JQuery: Run npm i jquery;

    In VS Code, in project you are working from, 
    add the following code: 
    <div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
        It works!
    </div>
    
    <script src="node_modules/jquery/dist/jquery.js"></script>
    <script src="node_modules/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.js"></script>
    
    If everything installed correctly, you should see the 
    alert 'It Works!' in the project when you open in 
    <browser-->
