        <!--Document Object Model: When a browser loads a webpage it organizes HTML elements into a DOM; 
            the DOM is a tree-like structure that we can traverse through using JavaScript to 
            locate specific elements which can be found by their, IDs, tag names, class names, or using 
            css selectors. Once we find an element in the DOM using JavaSCript, we can remove, change, or add to it; 
            that includes the ability to remove and add children elements and allows us to build dynamic  functionality
            to our pages -->

            <!--Finding Elements in the DOM-->

            <!--Finding an element by its ID 

            get element by ID method: takes a string that 
            represents the ID of the element; when the element
            with the given ID is found in the DOM the 
            element itself is the returned value of the 
            method  -->

         <!--<button id="my-button">Button 1</button>

           Find element by tag names: an element is
            denoted in HTML by its tags; the tag would be 
            whatever the text in the HTML element is-->

         <!-- <button>Button 2</button>
            <button class="my-class">Button 3</button>
           <button>Button 4</button>
            <button class="my-class">Button 5</button>
            
            Find element by class name; classes are used 
                to identify multiple elements that share the 
                same style; when we find elements by class we 
                say get elementS becasue we find multiple elements-->

            <!--Find elements by CSS selector: use DOMs 
                "query selector all" method and pass in a 
                string that is a valid CSS selector: how 
                we would write a CSS rule to style 
                specific elements; any element that would 
                typically be styled by a given CSS selector
                will be returned from the "query sleector all" 
                method-->    

           <!--<h1 class="my-class">Hello World</h1>-->
            
            <!--Interacting with the DOM: -->

           <p id="content">Hello.</p>
            <button id="btn">Change Value</button>
            <button id="remove">Remove paragraph from DOM</button>
           
            <div id="paragraphs">
                <p id="content">Hello.</p>
            </div>
            <button id="btn">Change Value</button>
            <button id="remove">Remove paragraph from DOM</button>
            <button id="add">Add New paragraph.</button>
            <input type="text" id="new-text">-->

            <div id="paragraphs">
                <p id="content">Hello.</p>
            </div>
            <button id="btn">Change Value</button> <br>
            <input type="remove-id">
