    <!--Installing JQuery:
        In the file you want to install JQuery, 
    * run npm init
    * accept all defaults
    * run npm i jquery
    * should appear in your vscode

    Testing to see if it works: 
        In JS document, 
    * console.log($('body'));
    * check console which should show 'jQuery.fn.init(1)'
    -->

    <!--JQuery allows us to select DOM elements using 
        CSS Selectors: class, element, and tag names; 
        also follows same rules as selectors: id is 
        denoted by '#'', class is denoted with a '.', 
        and tag names are just the text of the tag itself. 
        JQuery uses a function with the name of a $ symbol
        to shorten code; to select a symbol we only need 
        to type the $ symbol followed by parentheses and 
        pass in the selector as a string-->
        
        <input type="text">
        <p id="test">Hello World</p>
        <div class="my-class">Div</div>
        <ul>
            <li>One</li>
            <li>Two</li>
            <li>Three</li>
        </ul>
        

        <!--Ways to interact with the elements: when JQuery
        returns an element it doesn't use it the same 
        way document.getElementById does; it returns it 
        wrapped inside a jQuery object with additional built-
        in methods for us to use to interact with that part of 
        the DOM; these methods allow us to set the text, 
        HTML, values, and attributes of existing elements; 
        while other methods allow us to add, remove, hide, and 
        show elements-->
