        <!--When we type a URL into our browser, it sends an
        HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) request: 
        to the server whose IP address is correlated with 
        the domain name in the URL. The server responds to 
        the request with documents or data (HTML page with JS 
        and CSS files. When the browser receives this response
        it reloads the entire DOM and renders everything. 
        Sometimes a web page only needs a subsection to be 
        updated without anything else being changed. Instead 
        of reloading the entire page we can use AJAX: 
        Asynchronous JavaScript and XML: allows us
        to send a request and get back data behind the scenes 
        asynchronously without having to reload the entire 
        page, and while keeping the current page running 
        as a normal web page until the response comes back -->

        <!--JQuery methods: Get and Post: both request data
        from a server; but the post method has an extra 
        parameter that allows us to send a payload to the 
        server which is typically used to update information
        on the server in a modern web development 
        environment-->
