Text Elements: headings, paragraphs and formatting 
    elements -->
<!--Anchors and Images: attributes pointing to the address
    of the image being displayed, or to the location where the
    link will redirect the user web click; absolute path to the 
    directory/address: exact address of where something lives;
    a url that goes to a specific page on a specific website is an 
    absolute path; relative path to a directory/address: pointing
    to something relative to where we are = points to a directory
    that is two directories up from the director where our HTML
    file is located if it is on the same server, as opposed to
    to putting the exact address on the internet to where the 
    resource is -->

<!--Absolute Path: takes us directly to the website in
    the anchor--> 
<!--<a href="https://google.com">Google</a> <br>--><!--Absolute Path-->

<!--Relative Path: creates a link inside the HTML page that 
    links additional pages for the website (in other words, 
    if you create multiple folders, pages, or store images 
    within a code editing software directory, you can link those pages and images to the
    html page; this is a relative path: the files are in the same
    directory and being linked to one another-->

Inline Vs. Block-->

<!--A block element takes up the entire width of its 
    parent: if there is more than one element on a 
    line, even if there is enough space for both elements,
    the second image will take upm a new line; with 
    inline elements, multiple elements can fit on the same 
    line; structred elements can fall into one or the 
    other category; div (block elemnet) and span (inline
    element) structure elements

    <div>
        <h1>Div 1</h1>
        <p>Anything in this is grouped together like an 
        invisible box</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h1>Div 2</h1>
        <p>Div 2 paragraph</p>
    </div>

    <p>This is some text, <span>here is text inside a span,
        </span> and here is some more text</p> 
    
    A span can be targeted with CSS or JavaScript-->
